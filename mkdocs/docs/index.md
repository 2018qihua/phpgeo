phpgeo is a small PHP library which provides abstractions to geographical coordinates (including support for different ellipsoids), polylines ("tracks"), polygons, bounds, and more. phpgeo allows you to perform different calculations with these abstractions, as distances, track lengths, etc.

phpgeo is developed by [Marcus Jaschen](https://www.marcusjaschen.de/) and all [contributors](https://github.com/mjaschen/phpgeo/graphs/contributors).
