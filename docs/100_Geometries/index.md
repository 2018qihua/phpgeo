# Geometries

_phpgeo_ provides several geometry classes:

* [`Point`](Point)
* [`Line`](Line)
* [`Polyline`](Polyline)
* [`Polygon`](Polygon)

`Point` represents a geographic location, i. e. it contains a latitude
and a longitude - together with an so called Ellipsoid.

`Line` consists of two points, while `Polyline` and `Polygon` are built
from two or more points.
